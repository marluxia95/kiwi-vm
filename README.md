# Kiwi-VM

Simple Virtual Machine made in C++. 

This isn't the final version and I am still working on it

### Build Steps 

In order to build it, you need g++ or any other compiler and make. Then just run make and a executable file will be generated.

### How to use

In order to assemble a file, run : 

` ./kiwi_vm -c source.asm binary.bin `

In order to run a binary file run : 

` ./kiwi_vm -r binary.bin `

You can enable debug mode by adding the `--debug` argument.
